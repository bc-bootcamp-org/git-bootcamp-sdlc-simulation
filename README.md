# Git & GitHub Bootcamp – SDLC Simulation

Welcome to the **Git & GitHub Bootcamp: SDLC Simulation** repository.  
This project is part of a hands-on exercise that simulates a real-world Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using Git and GitHub.  
Participants collaborate on feature branches, raise pull requests, and experience the end-to-end development flow.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js version 14 or higher  
- npm (or yarn)  
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub  

### Installation & Running Locally  
1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bc-bootcamp-org/git-bootcamp-sdlc-simulation.git
   cd git-bootcamp-sdlc-simulation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser at:**  
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Available Scripts  
- `npm run dev` – starts the dev server  
- `npm run build` – builds the app for production  
- `npm run preview` – previews the production build locally  
- `npm run lint` – runs ESLint for code quality

## 🌐 Live Deployment Links

Each branch in this repository is deployed automatically via **Netlify**.  
You can view the live preview for each branch using the URLs below:

| Branch | Live URL |
|--------|-----------|
| `main` | https://bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |
| `dev` | https://dev-bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |
| `team-a` | https://team-a-bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |
| `team-b` | https://team-b-bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |
| `team-c` | https://team-c-bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |
| `team-d` | https://team-d-bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |
| `team-e` | https://team-e-bootcamp.jenishtwayana.com.np |

> 📝 *Note:* The branch deployments may take a few minutes to update after a merge or commit.

## 🧑‍💻 Workflow / Simulation Scenario

This repository is used for simulating collaborative development within a bootcamp context.  
The standard workflow includes:

1. **Create a feature branch** (e.g., `team-a/john-addcomponent`)  
2. **Make changes** to your team's module or files  
3. **Commit and push** your branch to GitHub  
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** for review  
5. **Collaborate through code reviews** (approve or request changes)  
6. **Merge the PR** into the `main` branch after approval  
7. **View deployment** at your branch’s live URL  

This simulation helps participants practice real-world SDLC concepts — planning, version control, collaboration, and release workflows — in a controlled learning environment.

## 🧭 Goal

The goal of this exercise is to help learners understand:
- How teams collaborate using Git & GitHub  
- The branching, review, and merging workflow  
- How CI/CD connects to deployments per branch  
- The full SDLC from feature development to release
